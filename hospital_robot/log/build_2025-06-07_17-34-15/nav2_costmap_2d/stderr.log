[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findlaser_geometry.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "laser_geometry", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "laser_geometry"
  with any of the following names:

    laser_geometryConfig.cmake
    laser_geometry-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "laser_geometry" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "laser_geometry_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "laser_geometry" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
